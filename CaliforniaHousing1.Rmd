## California House Pricing Data

  The contents of the California House Pricing Dataset represent information on houseswithin a given block in California from the 1990 census. The variables outlined in the dataset are given below in the following table. Each variable corresponds to an attribute of the observational unit, the collection of houses within one square block in the state. Using this data, we can analyze and interpret basic trends that can lead to insight into what factors contribute the housing market in the state of California.

| Variables | Description |
| :----------- | :------------------------ |
| Longitude           | Westward location; higher value is farther West|
| Latitude            | Northward location; higher value is farther North.|
| Housing Median Age  | Age of houses within a block. |
| Total Rooms         | The total number of rooms within a given block. |
| Total Bedrooms      | The total number of bedrooms within a given block. |
| Population          | The total population within a given block.|
| Households          | The total number of households within a given block. |
| Median Income       | The median total income of households within a given block (Measured in 10s of thousands of USD) |
| Median House Value  | The median valuation of houses in a given block in USD|
| Ocean Proximity     | The location of the block in relation to the nearest ocean/sea|


Perhaps the most important variable from this given data set is the Median House Value of the houses within any given block. This variable will have the greatest importance to the audience this data is attempting to serve, those interested in the details of land ownership within the state of California. Because this variable is the most influential, it is imperative that we take a deeper dive into how it fits into the data given through the 1990 California census data.

# House Value Analysis
In order to begin analyzing our data, we must first read in the census data in its entirety, then take a smaller samples size (around 500 observations) in order to look at the trends of the given data. In order to produce repeatable results, we set the seed in the following code chunk to '1', so the resulting sample will draw from the same observations every time. If a different observation set is required, we can simply change the seed.

```{r initialization, echo=FALSE}
#Initializes the data.
complete_housing_dataset<-read_csv('C:/Users/orion/Documents/PSTAT126/housing.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
#Sets set for repeatability.
set.seed(4)
#Samples a random selection of 500 rows from the complete data set. Returns their
# corresponding numbers (Housing Data Rows).
hdr<- sample(1:nrow(complete_housing_dataset), 500, replace=FALSE)
#Assigns the sample to a new dataset.
data_sample <- complete_housing_dataset[hdr,]
```
Now that we have defined our sample, we can utilize built in R functions to perform statistical analysis on our data set. As we are currently reviewing the median house value variable, it would be important to learn more about how the values of this element are structured; therefore, the distribution plot of the variable is included below.

```{r value_summary, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4.5,fig.height=2.5,fig.align='left'}
par(cex.axis = 0.6) 
ggplot(data_sample, aes(x = median_house_value)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Density of Median House Value in 90s CA", x = "Median House Value (In USD)", y = "Density")
```
From this plot of the distribution of median house value, it can be concluded that the data is heavily left skewed meaning that there is a larger percentile of homes within the \$0 to \$250,000 price range.  This trend is similarly shown in other data samples generated from varying seeds. One aspect to notice of this graph is the small inflection towards the right end of the distribution function where the amount of homes at the given price range tends to increase in comparison to the amount at the intermediate value. In conjunction, these two observations of the data suggest to us that the median housing values across the state of California tend to be representative of higher volumes in the $100,000 range while the amount of homes decreases as the price increases except for an outlying greater number of homes in the higher price range. In addition to the distribution function, it can be beneficial to display more information about the break down of this variable's distribution. Concisely, using the 'skim' function from the 'skimr' package in R will give us a brief summary of the statistics that we can utilize later on in our analysis. 
```{r skim_value, eval=FALSE}
skim(data_sample$median_house_value)
```

| Statistic            | Value    |
|----------------------|----------|
| Mean                 | 210,605  |
| Standard Deviation   | 113,318  |
| 1st Percentile (1st) | 36,700   |
| 25th Percentile (25th)| 127,025  |
| Median (50th)        | 185,100  |
| 75th Percentile (75th)| 263,925  |
| Maximum (100th)      | 500,001  |


# The Relationship Between Ocean Distance and Property Value
Now that we have introduced and begun to discuss one of the more influential variables form the California Housing data set, its imperative that we take a deeper look into more variables, as well as analyzing any relationships they might have with one another. One of the more obvious relationships that can be observed from the data without much foresight is a possible connection between the median property value of homes within a block and the distance that the corresponding block is from the ocean. Based on intuition and general knowledge, it's safe to assume that it is very likely that houses that are closer to the beach are more likely to have a higher median property value, and vice versa. Consequently, we can use formulas built into R to take a look at a the possible existence of a relationship between the variable "Median House Value" and "Ocean Proximity" to see if we our intuitions are justified. The following graph plots Median House Value within each block in the sample data set against the block's proximity to the ocean.
```{r keeps, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5.5,fig.height=3,fig.align='center'}
par(cex.axis = 0.7) 
boxplot(data_sample$median_house_value ~ data_sample$ocean_proximity,
        xlab = "Ocean Proximity", ylab = "Median House Value (In USD)",
        main = "Boxplot of Median House Value by Ocean Proximity",
        col = "blue", outline = FALSE)
```
As the box plot above demonstrates, there seems to be a trend that homes within the data sample tend to have an increased property value if they are under an hour away from the ocean or a bay in comparison to homes inland in California. These observations concur with the data samples generated by different seeds.

# Median Income Analysis
Another very influential variable from the data set is the observations of "Median Income" throughout houses on an identified block. This variable gives the median income, in tens of thousands of United States Dollars, of each block. Therefore, each individual within a home contributes to their houses income, which then outlined per block where the median is then calculated which is the resulting value that is contained in the data set. This variable can be quite insightful to the audience as well because it is closely relatable to the viewer; therefore, understanding the statistical data around it is quite important. Like shown before with the median house value variable, utilizing R plot the distribution function for this variable is a good place to start.
```{r income, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4.5,fig.height=2.5,fig.align='left'}
par(cex.axis = 0.6) 
ggplot(data_sample, aes(x = median_income)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(title = "Density of Median Income in 90s CA", x = "Median Income (10,000s of USD", y = "Density")
```
Similarly to the distribution graphs shown earlier, a quick and brief analysis of the distribution of Median Income shows that the distribution is also heavily skewed to the left. As a result, it suffices to say that both median income and median housing value contain some factors that draw out their distributions in such a manner. Likewise, utilizing 'skimr' produces a concise table of the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles in order to perform greater statistical analysis.
```{r skim_income, eval=FALSE}
skim(data_sample$median_income)
```


| Statistic            | Value (In 10,000s of USD)    |
|----------------------|----------|
| Mean                 | 3.9  |
| Standard Deviation   | 1.82  |
| 1st Percentile (1st) | 0.5   |
| 25th Percentile (25th)| 2.62  |
| Median (50th)        | 3.6  |
| 75th Percentile (75th)| 4.87  |
| Maximum (100th)      | 13.66  |

# The Relationship Between Property Value and Income
Lastly, it is of note to pay close attention to the relationship between both of these two variables listed above. Even though they share quite similarly left skewed distributions does not mean that they pertain any relationship. In order to dive a little bit deeper into these two statistics, we can graph a scatter plot in R that demonstrates their potential correlation which can be further refined later down the road. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3,fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = data_sample, aes(x = median_income, y = median_house_value)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Median Income (In 10,000s of USD)", y = "Median House Value (In USD)") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Median Income against Median House Value")
```
When layed out in a scatter plot as done above, these two variables demonstrate a linear progression of increasing value. Seemingly, as the median income of a particular housing block increases, so does the median house value.
